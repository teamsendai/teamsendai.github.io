					<p>In order to create Size-controllable Linear Homomultimer (SLH), we first prepared a monomer without blunt ends for stacking. We represent this monomer as “monomer (- -)”, where - and ? correspond to without stacking and without twist, respectively. The result of AFM imaging is shown in Fig. 1.</p>

					<p>In section 1 reached around 8 nm high, which suggests that the monomer had 4 layers of DNA helixes because the diameter of DNA double helix is 2 nm. The data indicates that the monomer has a shaft inside the outer cylinder. In Fig. 1-a, the monomers unexpectedly stacked and formed a multimer. Further optimization such as using shorter or less staple strands is necessary to prevent monomers from stacking to isolate the them.<br>Next, we changed some set of staple strands so that monomers can stack each other to form a linear homomultimer by blunt end stacking.
We represent this monomer as "monomer (+ -)", where + and - correspond to with stacking and without twist, respectively.
</p>
					<p>Then, we conneted monomers and created linear homomultimers (Fig. 2).</p>

        			</figure>

					<p>Since we did not limit the number to stacking by not twisting the shaft of the monomers in this case, homomultimers consist of more and more monomers as shown in Fig. 2-a. One of the decamer and its section profile are shown in Fig. 2-b and 2-c.<br>Finally, we controlled the number of stacking by twisting the shaft of the monomer and observed the multimers by AFM as shown in Fig. 3. We represent this monomer as "monomer (+ +)", where + and + correspond to with stacking and with twist, respectively.

        			</figure>
					
					<p>Similarly, we observed homomultimers as shown in Fig. 3. The number of stacking in Fig. 3, however, seems to be limited compared to that in Fig. 2. These AFM images clearly supports the our concept to control the number of stacking by introducing a twisted shaft. Fig. 3-b is one of the hexamer whose section profiles are shown in Fig. 3-c.<br>We analyzed the stacking number of monomer, homomultimer without twist, and SLH, then made a histogram and Poisson distribution respectively (Fig. 4). Each stacking number was counted by 3 different images taken from AFM.

        			<p>  SLH were designed to connect 11 monomers, but most of them consisted of 2 to 4 monomers. According to Fig. 2-a, some monomers without twist created a large size of homomultimer, but the peak of the distribution almost resembled that of SLH. There are several reasons why the monomers didn’t create a long linear homomultimer. As the monomers make stacking, the entropy decreases. But it generally increases to stabilize the whole energy. Therefore, monomers cannot create a long multimer. It seems that the multimers which consists of about 3 or 4 monomers is the most stable structure, which is in the equilibrium of the energy. Moreover, the multimers might be broken when observing by AFM. The structures might be broken when the sample adsorbed onto mica.  Also, the cantilever might break while attaching to them.　Furthermore, as the monomers which have a twisted shaft create SLH, the movement of the shaft is limited. This also decreases the possibility of stacking monomers.</p>
        			
        			
        			
        			
        			<h3>The result of cryo-TEM (Cryo-electron microscopy)</h3>
        			
					<p>To assure the three-dimensional structure, we observed the monomer by cryo-TEM which does not apply any additional force by the probe. Fig5. shows the  cross-section of the monomer in both caDNAno design and cryo-TEM image. The cryo-TEM image was recovered from multiple raw data using principal component analysis (detail in Material&Method). The diameter of the hollow cylinder and the shaft were 18 nm and 5.7 nm in Fig.5-b, and 18 nm and 6.5 nm in Fig. 5-c. This size is in good agreement with the caDAno design. Therefore we concluded that the monomer structure was properly formed. We observed extremely longer homomultimer in cryo-TEM compared with AFM, which may be because the force from AFM probe and adsorption to surface were eliminated. From these reason, Our DNA origami structure could make a long stacking structure correctly in the solution.</p>

        			<p>To identify the ability about stacking number control of our structure, we checked the stacking angle of 3 different sample (monomer(+/+) monomer(+/-) monomer(-/-)) from the AFM result. Each straight line was drawn on the central part of DNA origami structure, and observed the angle difference to examine stacking ranges. In the (a) monomer(+/+), There are a lot of short linear stacking structure, and the calculated average stacking angle is 1.13 ±2.1°.  This result shows each monomers relatively connect straight with maintaining the stacking number limit. In the case of (b) monomer(+/-), the monomars can connect unlimitedly. Observed structures are constructed comparatively linear and long multimers, and the average angle of first part (5 monomers) is 1.9°±2.5 , second part (6 monomers) is 1.2°±2.2°,and third part (8monomers) is 1.7°±6.5°. In these monomer(+/+) and monomer(+/-), monomers are connecting for not more than the average angle 2°. But, There are some mismatch connections in the longer structure of monomer(+/-). From this result, it's expected difficult to make a longer structure. Lastly, in the monomer(-/-), the monomars combined with high angle difference compared to the others. This is because the monomars wouldn't be connecting by using the shaft part stacking ability, but the hollow cylinders part stacking power. Interface of hollow cylinder don't have double stranded part by rejecting some staples to avoid unexpected stackings. but, it's difficult to prevent all stackings.</p>

					<h3>Monomer formation<br>Ratio of concentration</h3>
					
					<p> To investigate the good condition to produce monomers which have a shaft inside, we adjusted the concentrations of M13, cylinder staple (C), and shaft staple (S). The yields of monomers were calculated based on the height of the image taken by AFM. When the ratio of concentrations was M13:C:S=1:25:50, the yield was 50% (Fig. 8-a). By contrast, when the ratio was 1:10:50, the yields improved and reached to 80%, which suggests the high yields (Fig. 8-b).</p>
			
				<figure>
        			<img class="img-responsive" src="./img/experiment/Fig.8.png">
        			<figcaption id="mono-line">Fig. 8 Yields varied by ratio of the concentrations</figcaption>
        		</figure>

				
				<h3>Annealing condition</h3>
				
				<figure>
        			<img class="img-responsive" src="./img/experiment/Fig.9.png">
        			<figcaption id="mono-line">Fig. 9 Yields varied by several annealing conditions</figcaption>
        		</figure>
					
					<p> The annealing condition to create a monomer which has a shaft inside is showed in Fig. 10-2. Before we decided the condition, we tried the two other conditions described as Fig. 10-1 and 10-3. When the condition was Fig. 10-1, the cylinder formed a flat shape because the time of annealing was too short to form a three-dimensional shape (Fig. 10-d). On the other hand, when we annealed under the condition represented in Fig. 10-3, the monomer formed more complex shape than in Fig. 10-d (Fig. 10-e). But almost all of them were a flat shape as well as in Fig. 10-d. The gradient of annealing was so gentle that unexpected hybridizations might be induced. We picked up 20 monomers arbitrarily from Fig. 10-d and 10-e respectively, and calculated the yields of the monomer which is created as desired. There were no monomers as designed in both conditions.</p>
				
				
		<h3>Gel electrophoresis</h3>
					<p>We conducted gel shift assay in order to confirm whether the structures were created as we desired (Fig. 10).</p>

					<figure>
        				<img class="img-responsive" src="./img/experiment/Fig.10.png">
        				<figcaption id="mono-line">Fig. 10 Agarose gel electrophoresis </figcaption>
        			</figure>

					<p>The bands appeared in the same position. It means that the structures were not created properly and formed unexpected shape. This might be caused because while conducting the gel shift assay, the multimers were caught on the mesh of the gel and broken into smaller pieces. This result suggests that the strength of stacking was not so strong and explains why the long size of homomultimer hardly exists in Fig. 4.</p>
